<h1>On Abortion</h1>
<br/><br/>
<p>
Abortion is a women's reproductive issue where the pregnancy of a human fetus is terminated prematurely before the women has brought the fetus to term or birth. In the landmark case, Roe Vs. Wade the Supreme Court Of The United States declared that the right to privacy guranteed to people in the United States in the constitution was broad enough legally speaking to encompass a women's decision to carry out an abortion.
</p>
<p>
There are dozens of possible stances on abortion but they all fall generally into one of a few catagories. Someone who is pro-choice would believe strongly that abortion should be legally protected and that the decision should be left to the women. Conversely, a pro-life stance would be one that argues for the legal abolition of legally guranteed abortion. People's stances may also fall somewhere in between the two camps for instance theat abortion should only be allowed in instances of rape or when carrying the fetus to term could potentially threaten the mother's life. There are also those who are morally against abortion due to social or religious beliefs but also do not believe that the government has the right to regulate a female's body. In general, conservatives tend to be more pro-life while liberals tend to be more pro-choice, but as with every issue, the divide in opinion never breaks neatly down party lines and there is a large populaiton that deviate from this over simplified generilization.

<h3>Possible Stances</h3>
<div id="iss12">
<p>• I am morally against it, but believe if a women is going to undergo one, she should have access to a procedure with all the safeguards of modern medicine</p>
<p>• I am morally against it, but do not believe that the government has the authortity to regulate the functions of a women's body</p>
<p>• I am Pro-choice, but believe that the government should invest in better sexual education and services like planned parenthood to provide free or low-cost services,contraceptives and birth control to decrease the need for abortions among the most at-risk populations</p>
<p>• I am pro-choice, but only in cases of Rape or potential harm to the mother while carrying the fetus to term</p>
<p>• I am pro-choice in all cases, a women's body belongs to that women and she should be able to make the decisions she deems necessary</p>
<p>• I am pro-choice, but only in case where consent of both parents is obtained even if the other parent has abandoned the mother</p>
<p>• I am pro-choice My religion forbides abortion but I recognize that people have the right to practice whatever religion they would like and as such realize I do not have the right to enforce my beliefs on others</p>
<p>• I am pro-choice, but only until a certain point in the pregnancy</p>
<p>• I am pro-life, Abortion is murder</p>
