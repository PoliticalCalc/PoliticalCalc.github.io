        <h3>Abortion</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>Abortion is a women's reproductive issue where the pregnancy of a human fetus is terminated
						prematurely before the women has brought the fetus to term or birth. In the landmark case, Roe v
						Wade the Supreme Court of The United States declared that the right to privacy guaranteed to people 
						in the United States in the constitution was broad enough legally speaking to encompass a women's 
						decision to carry out an abortion.</p>
						<p>There are dozens of possible stances on abortion but they all fall generally into one of a few 
						categories. Someone who is pro-choice would believe strongly that abortion should be legally protected
						and that the decision should be left to the women. Conversely, a pro-life stance would be one that argues
						for the legal abolition of legally guaranteed abortion. People's stances may also fall somewhere in between 
						the two camps for instance that abortion should only be allowed in instances of rape or when carrying the 
						fetus to term could potentially threaten the mother's life. There are also those who are morally against 
						abortion due to social or religious beliefs but also do not believe that the government has the right to 
						regulate a female's body. In general, conservatives tend to be more pro-life while liberals tend to be more 
						pro-choice, but as with every issue, the divide in opinion never breaks neatly down party lines and there is
						a large population that deviate from this over simplified generalization. </p>

						<br>
                        <p>Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides health services to women. The organization
						does provide abortion services to women and in the past, has been federally funded but zero dollars
						of taxpayer money was diverted into abortion funding. Instead the federal funding that used to 
						account for over forty percent of the non-profits revenue was spent on other reproductive health 
						services like contraceptives, birth control and breast cancer screenings. President Trump imposed 
						what is referred to as the "Global Gag Rule" through executive order. This order prevents orginizations 
						that offer abortion services from receiving federal funding. These orginizations, however,
						provide other important services both to people domestically and in developing countries through the medical care they administer.</p>

						<p>&#9679 Planned Parenthood and other NGOS provide important health services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them. Federal funding should therefore be guaranteed to these orginizations, but federal funding should not be used to fund abortions</p>
						<p>&#9679 Planned Parenthood and other NGOS provide important health services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them. Federal funding should therefore be guaranteed to these orginizations especially in the case of abortions as it provides the women with quality medical care rather than riskier alternatives</p>
						<p>&#9679 Abortion is morally wrong and all federal funds should be withheld from the organization because they would struggle financially without federal funds and would therefore choose to eliminate the practice of abortion over losing federal funding</p>
						<p>&#9679 I agree with the stated goals of the organization, but the government has no right to spend tax payer money on health services</p>
						<p>&#9679 Planned Parenthood and other NGOS are one step away from socialized  Medicare</p>

                        <h3>Government Bailouts</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>Leading up to 2008, banks began making risky investments in sub-prime mortgages. 
						Sub-prime mortgages were given to people who otherwise would not have gotten a mortgage 
						and when the housing bubble burst, people were left paying mortgages on homes that were worth less than
						what they had bought them for. These mortgages were then packaged and sold on the financial market as mortgage-backed securities.
						The ownership of these special securities caused the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history when Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11
						bankruptcy protection in September 2008. Just two months earlier, the Pasadena, California based IndyMac 
						mortgage corporation was seized by the federal government and placed into the receivership of the Federal 
						Deposit Insurance Corporation where its assets were acquired by one west bank signaling the beginning of the
						2008 financial crisis. This was the largest bank failure up until that of Lehman Brothers just a few months later. 
						The failure of IndyMac was preceded by U.S. Senator Charles Schumer warning the public about IndyMac, and resulted
						in a bank run with customers withdrawing more than 7.5% of the banks total on hand assets in just a few days. The
						failure of IndyMac then caused bank runs across the country, namely at Washington Mutual where $9.4 billion
						were withdrawn in the following days. After Moody's downgraded Washington Mutual's debt, another bank run ensued
						and the bank was seized by the federal government. It was placed in the receivership of The Federal Deposit Insurance 
						Corporation where its $307 billion in assets were sold off to J.P. Morgan Chase. </p>
						<p>The future of the U.S. economy seemed bleek, so the Secretary of the Treasury with the cooperation of President George W. 
						Bush drafted legislation that would see Washington acquire $700 Billion of these risky mortgage-backed securities from financial
						institutions. This was an attempt to prevent anymore large banks from failing detrimentally to the economy. The idea was that the banks 
						individually controlled so much of the domestic and global financial systems that even letting just one fail would destroy the economy, 
						possibly leading to a depression. However, the banks that received taxpayer money, in some cases, had no obligation to pay back 
						the government for the bailout money and bankers never faced any criminal charges for essentially bringing the largest economy in
						the world to a screeching halt. The stimulus package was then later extended by President Obama to include American Auto Makers 
						General Motors and Chrysler. The federal government obtained a 60% controlling stake in General Motors for just shy of $70 billion 
						and fired its then CEO and led the company towards a restructuring due to their strategic economic importance. The government also forced
						Chrysler to merge with Italian Fiat Motors to form Fiat Chrysler Group in order to ensure their survival.</p>
						<p>The political debate rages on over whether the federal government has the right to appropriate taxpayer money to private corporations
						and if they do have this right, then to what extent should it be used? Should it only be used to bail out too big to fail banks? Only small
						banks? Only firms strategically important to the economy? </p>
						<br><br>

						<p>&#9679 The government has no right to appropriate taxpayer money to fund private industry</p>

                        <h3>Minimum Wage</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 per hour. Four States, Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, and Wyoming, however, 
						have state minimum wage requirements that are lower than that set by the federal government. These are not implemented in practice 
						because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution that states that if a conflicting law exists on a state and federal level, the
						federal law is always applied thus nullifying the state law. According to the Pew Research Center, the minimum wage peaked in 1968 at about 
						$8.68 accounting for inflation, and that in the almost 50 years since then, minimum wage earners have lost nearly 10% of their purchasing 
						power due to inflation. Some would simply like the minimum wage to keep up with the rate of inflation, while others want a Living Wage 
						like that demanded by the fight for $15 movement. A Living Wage is what some consider the minimum to live comfortably and get by. Detractors 
						of the Living Wage argument would point out that minimum wage positions are intended for younger employees working entry-level positions, and
						these workers should put in the effort for job advancement. Cities, like San Francisco and Seattle, have worked towards a goal of a $15 Living Wage
						minimum. Detractors would like to point out that prices of goods and services under this law would rise and that the rise in prices would lead
						to faster rates of inflation. Another argument against a higher minimum wage is that it would eliminate jobs as companies would rather eliminate low 
						skill jobs, especially in service positions, and replace them with robots causing strain on the social welfare systems.</p>

						<p>&#9679 The Federal Government should set higher minimum wages in "development zones" or low-income neighborhoods where individuals are more likely to work in and thus depend on the income from a minimum wage job</p>
						<p>&#9679 The Federal Government should keep the minimum wage at the same level but provide social safety net assistance for those below a certain threshold that extends above the poverty line</p>

                        <h3>Defense Spending</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>According to AlJazeera, the U.S. annual defense expenditure is $596 Billion or 36% of the worlds total military spending. 
						In 2014, with a defense budget of $682 Billion, the United States outspent China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia,
						India, Germany, Italy, and Brazil, or more than the next top 10 military spenders combined and still had an extra $30 billion. 
						Some argue that America has taken on too large of a foreign policy role as "the world's policeman", and that it should scale back this 
						role to focus on domestic issues like healthcare. Others argue that the defense money could be more wisely spent on Universal Healthcare 
						or funding the scientific and intellectual progressions of NASA and possibly a Mars mission. Some argue defense spending should be cut in
						order to decrease our budget deficit. Others argue that we should increase our global presence to solidify our role in foreign policy as a global 
						superpower. Should the United States invest so much in its armed forces or would the money be more wisely used on domestic programs?</p>

                        <h3>Federal Government and Education</h3>
						<br>
						<p>Common Core is a set of standards intended for implementation in the United States public school system. The
						standards are a shared set of expectations of what students should know at the end of a given school year to prepare for the future.
						Earlier similar initiatives like President George W. Bush's "No Child Left Behind" 
						aimed to accomplish a similar goal. Opposition argues that education should either be more personalized or that the 
						federal government should not have a hand in deciding what a child must or must not learn. Standardized tests are another
						educational issue in that not only may some students not test well, but teachers may teach for 
						the purpose of meeting the standards set by the test rather than to ensure that students are learning. Standardized 
						tests, some may argue, also apply an arbitrary metric to a child making them nothing more than a score and measuring
						their performance in set areas that they may or may not be strong in, such as, Math and English, while ignoring equally 
						important areas like Science and History. The educational experience varies greatly across the country and lags behind 
						the rest of the world and these are attempts to make the U.S. school system better on a base level and internationally more competitive.</p>

						<br>
						<p>Climate change is the idea that there is a global change in climate patterns caused by humans. This is probably
						one of the messier political debates but presented here are a variety of stances one could take. 10,883 of 10,885 peer 
						reviewed scientific articles and journal entries agree that climate change is a real phenomenon, and that humans to at least some 
						extent caused it. Exxon Mobil had knowledge of this phenomenon as early as the late 1970's, but chose not to share this information
						with the public. Most scientists predict a global increase in mean teparatures of around 1 degree centigrade and that along
						with the loss of the polar ice caps, global sea levels could rise as much as 20 feet. With the potential for global catastrophe,
						some argue that the science is out and that with past events like the Ice Age, the global temperatures too changed drastically and 
						that humans are not the cause of the current temperature fluctuations. Others want the government to take a hardline stance in providing
						funding for alternative energy sources (ie. solar and wind) to avoid the potential climate calamity.</p>

						than marriage. Some argue that gay marriage has contributed to some sort of societal "moral decay".
						Others think that homosexuality is incompatible with their values and/or religion. In the landmark case
						Obergefell v. Hodges, same sex marriage was guaranteed across all 50 states. While Gay Marriage is currantly guranteed

						The basic premise of this policy was that a service member would not be asked about their orientation and they would not be discharged 
						simply for being gay, but if they had any relations while in the army or told anyone that would be considered homosexual activity, 
						and as such the service member would then be discharged. "Don't ask, don't tell" was repealed in 2010, and since 2011, service members have

                        <h3>Government Bailouts</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>Leading up to 2008, banks began making risky investments in sub-prime mortgages. 
						Sub-prime mortgages were given to people who otherwise would not have gotten a mortgage 
						and when the housing bubble burst, people were left paying a mortgage on homes that were worth less
						what they had bought them. These mortgages were then packaged and sold on the financial market as mortgage-backed securities.
						The ownership of these special securities caused the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history when Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11
						bankruptcy protection in September 2008. Just two months earlier, the Pasadena, California based IndyMac 
						mortgage corporation was seized by the federal government and placed into the receivership of the Federal 
						Deposit Insurance Corporation where its assets were acquired by one west bank signaling the beginning of the
						2008 financial crisis. This was the largest bank failure up until that of Lehman Brothers just a few months later. 
						The failure of IndyMac was preceded by U.S. Senator Charles Schumer warning the public about IndyMac, and resulted
						in a bank run with customers withdrawing more than 7.5% of the banks total on hand assets in just a few days. The
						failure of IndyMac then caused bank runs across the country, namely at Washington Mutual where $9.4 billion
						were withdrawn in the following days. After Moody's downgraded Washington Mutual's debt, another bank run ensued
						and the bank was seized by the federal government. It was placed in the receivership of The Federal Deposit Insurance 
						Corporation where its $307 billion in assets were sold off to J.P. Morgan Chase. </p>
						<p>The future of the U.S. economy seemed bleek, so the Secretary of the Treasury with the cooperation of President George W. 
						Bush drafted legislation that would see Washington acquire $700 Billion of these risky mortgage-backed securities from financial
						institutions. This was an attempt to prevent anymore large banks from failing detrimentally to the economy. The idea was that the banks controlled 
						individually so much of the domestic and global financial systems that even letting just one fail would destroy the economy, 
						possibly leading to a depression. However, the banks that received taxpayer money, in some cases, had no obligation to pay back 
						the government for the bailout money and bankers never faced any criminal charges for essentially bringing the largest economy in
						the world to a screeching halt. The stimulus package was then later extended by President Obama to include American Auto Makers 
						General Motors and Chrysler. The federal government obtained a 60% controlling stake in General Motors for just shy of $70 billion 
						and fired its then CEO and led the company towards a restructuring due to their strategic economic importance. The government also forced
						Chrysler to merge with Italian Fiat Motors to form Fiat Chrysler Group in order to ensure their survival.</p>
						<p>The political debate rages on over whether the federal government has the right to appropriate taxpayer money to private corporations
						and if they do have this right, then to what extent should it be used? Should it only be used to bail out too big to fail banks? only small
						banks? only firms strategically important to the economy? </p>

						<br>
                        <p>Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 per hour. Four States, Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, and Wyoming, however, 
						have state minimum wage requirements that are lower than that set by the federal government. These are not implemented in practice 
						because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution that states that if a conflicting law exists on a state and federal level, the
						federal law is always applied thus nullifying the state law. According to the Pew Research Center, the minimum wage peaked in 1968 at about 
						$8.68 accounting for inflation, and that in the almost 50 years since then, minimum wage earners have lost nearly 10% of their purchasing 
						power due to inflation. Some would simply like the minimum wage to keep up with the rate of inflation, while others want a Living Wage 
						like that demanded by the fight for $15 movement. A Living Wage is what some consider the minimum to live comfortably and get by. Detractors 
						of the Living Wage argument would point out that minimum wage positions are intended for younger employees working entry-level positions, and
						these workers should put in the effort for job advancement. Cities, like San Francisco and Seattle, have worked towards a goal of a $15 Living Wage
						minimum. Detractors would like to point out that prices of goods and services under this law would rise that rise in prices would lead
						to faster rates of inflation. Another argument against a higher minimum wage is that it would eliminate jobs as companies would rather eliminate low 
						skill jobs, especially in service positions, and replace them with robots causing strain on the social welfare systems.</p>

						the purpose of meeting the standards set by the test rather than to ensure that students are learning. Standardized 
						tests, some may argue, also apply an arbitrary metric to a child making them nothing more than a score and measuring
						their performance in set areas that they may or may not be strong in, such as, math and English, while ignoring equally
