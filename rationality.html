<h1>Rationality</h1>
<p>The Political Calculator started as a small project but as our ambitions grew the team balloned in size. It began with a request from our history teacher Mr.Malagold, he had asked us to look into creating a better political spectrum quiz. He wanted one that mapped your views on other axis, not just the standard x,y plane but also to show where users fell on issues economically,socially and in other catagories as well. We wanted to create a project that hepled us collect data and analyze trends both in a small setitng like an individual classroom or school but also applaying the same data analytics to geographical locales like cities, counties, states and even potentially geographical ragions of the country. The political calculator as it currently stands is not that, but rather a stepping stone to that end goal a showcase of our abilities and a codebase to build off of for the final product.</p>

<div id="Algorithm">
<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<p>	We used two algorithms for our political calculator. One that is used for our authoritarian vs libertarian graphing and one that is used for our conservative vs liberal function. The first algorithm is relatively simple. We keep track of two variables that account for an individual’s levels of authoritarianism and libertarianism. These are then entered into a function which calculates your overall plot on the x-axis. The algorithm for conservative vs liberal is slightly more complicated. We decided that we want it to be extremely difficult for a person to wind up all the way on the right or the left. To account for this we used logarithms that take into account 4 variables. The variables are “Major Conservative”, “Slight Conservative”, “Slight Liberal”, and “Major Liberal”. The logs make it so that the higher your conservative or liberal value is, the less a difference it makes. We then enter these values into a calibrated algorithm, which graphs your overall value on the x-axis.
