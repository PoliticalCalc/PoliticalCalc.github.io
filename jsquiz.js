//To Do code logic here


//How to implement interface against the JSON answer key

//all questions are assigned a answer key for their values and which varible they represent

//the answers are declared as a string type representing the variable that the answer represents

//a point value or position not represented in a question is set initialized through default case of a string of "false" to be interpreted literally

//TO get the point value and side to increment perform a check of user response from the radial button to the string in each positon until a match is found and the match will increment accordingly

//To add new questions place them in the questions.json file in accordance with JSON syntax

//implement Ip logging here

//implement another blank text field to take user generated possible answers, set ranking of the text response to 0
